### 🚀 Projects

Here are a few projects I'm proud of:

- 🍿 [PopcornPick – AI Movie Recommendation App](https://github.com/talinbansal/Movie-Recommender)
  A full-stack movie discovery platform that uses semantic embeddings and FAISS vector search to recommend similar films. Features user authentication, watchlists, ratings, and a modern React +    TypeScript UI, deployed with FastAPI and PostgreSQL on Render.

- 🔁 **[Automated File Organizer Monitor](https://github.com/talinbansal/Automated-File-Organizer-Monitor)**  
  A Python desktop utility that auto-sorts files based on type and folder rules. This is ideal for productivity junkies.
  
- ✅ **[Task Manager](https://github.com/talinbansal/task-manager)**  
  Built with TypeScript, a clean and functional task-tracking web app with a modern UI.
