- 📌 Looking for **Fullstack/Software Development internships** (Summer/Fall 2025)

### 🚀 Projects

Here are a few projects I'm proud of:

- 🔁 **[Automated File Organizer Monitor](https://github.com/talinbansal/Automated-File-Organizer-Monitor)**  
  A Python desktop utility that auto-sorts files based on type and folder rules — ideal for productivity junkies.
  
- ✅ **[Task Manager](https://github.com/talinbansal/task-manager)**  
  Built with TypeScript — a clean and functional task-tracking web app with a modern UI.

- ⚽ **[Soccer Fan Dashboard](https://github.com/talinbansal/Soccer-Fan-Dashboard)**  
  Real-time stats and game tracking for fans using JavaScript and live APIs.
